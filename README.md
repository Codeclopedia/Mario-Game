# Mario Game

The beloved Super mario game with Flutter Animations and Sound Effects compatible in both Andriod and IOS.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter mario game application.

## Project Structure:

The rough breakdown of the current state of the game will consist of Game Logic, I/O and Sound Effects. The game logic consists of collision detection, jump detection, and clouds AI. The I/O includes mostly interaction with touch and if time forbids, maybe a keyboard/joystick to make it accessible on PCs too.

## Dependencies:

Further during the timeline, the plan is to improve the frame rate, add a ranking system based on highscore and implement shortest path algorithm for jumps and add different new adventure in the game.
